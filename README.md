🚀 Python Backend, Data Analysis & ML Practice Repository

This repository captures my hands-on learning journey with Python, focused on building backend systems, processing real-world data, visualizing insights, and understanding machine learning fundamentals.
Everything here is practice-driven, implementation-focused, and aimed at building strong foundations for scalable backend and data-driven applications.

🧠 What I Practiced
🐍 Python Core → Advanced

Strengthened Python fundamentals for backend & data work

Deep dive into OOP (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction)

Advanced concepts: file handling, exceptions, comprehensions, generators

Practical usage of standard libraries like os, datetime, json, re

⚙️ Advanced Python & Data Handling

Functional programming (map, filter, reduce)

Decorators, context managers & logging

NumPy for fast numerical operations

Cleaning and preparing raw CSV, JSON, and log data

🌐 Backend APIs with Django REST Framework

Built backend-only REST APIs

Worked with serializers, ViewSets, routers

Implemented JWT & token authentication

Added permissions, pagination, filtering & throttling

Documented APIs using Swagger / OpenAPI

⚡ FastAPI (Async Backend)

Designed high-performance async APIs

Used Pydantic for validation

Dependency injection & middleware

JWT authentication & exception handling

Auto-generated docs with Swagger UI & ReDoc

📊 Data Analysis with Pandas

Data cleaning & transformation using DataFrames

Handling missing values & datetime data

Aggregations, grouping, merging

Backend log analysis:

Extracted IPs, endpoints, response times

Calculated latency & throughput metrics

📈 Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

Line, bar, scatter & histogram plots

Heatmaps, pair plots & distributions

Turning backend & analytical data into insights

🤖 Machine Learning Basics

End-to-end ML workflow (preprocessing → training → evaluation)

Implemented models using scikit-learn:

Linear & Logistic Regression

K-Means Clustering

Evaluated models using Accuracy, RMSE, MAE
